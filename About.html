             I was a noob in Web development and so am I right now.
             Because the "was" wasn't that far from now. Despite of being a noob,not even an amateur,
             I was able to build this website . Because, hell with the experience.
             Its your potential that does bring the resolution .The only thing you need to do is to give your shit.
             Because if you ain't giving a shit ,nothing is ever gonna happen.
             Just by listening to the lectures by someone , where they do the shit and you only get to see the shit they do,
             trust me, u ain't gonna get a shit .It all seems like ,"Wow!! thats damn easy!! Anyone can do that.
             But the thing is "Action speaks louder than words". So, only when are you gonna start doing things, so are you gonna 
             do miracles and so are you gonna become the miracle . The only thing i wanna convey to everyone is 
             "If You don't give a shit ,then your life is gonna be shit " 
                                   and
             "If you are gonna give a shit, then your life ain't gonna be a shit"
